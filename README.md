# react-pageloom

`react-pageloom` is a unique React component library designed for seamless construction of single-page applications. Inspired by the craft of weaving, `react-pageloom` brings together individual components - `LoomHeader`, `LoomBlock`, and `LoomFooter` - to create a comprehensive, interconnected webpage. With `react-pageloom`, each `LoomBlock` you add dynamically integrates with the `LoomHeader`, building a navigation system that smoothly scrolls through full-screen blocks of content. Craft your single-page applications with ease and elegance using `react-pageloom`.
